# 汇编

```
1 byte = 8 bit
1 KB = 1024 byte
1 MB = 1024 KB
1 GB = 1024 MB
```

```
1 KB = 2^10 byte
1 MB = 2^20 byte
1 GB = 2^30 byte
```



a 32 bit computer has 32 address lines, so it can mostly find addresses:


$$
2^{32} bit = 2^2\times2^{10}\times2^{10}KB=2^2\times2^{10}MB=2^2GB= 4GB
$$
*Tips: The minist memory is 8 bit = 1 byte*



* address line -> CUP's  capability of find address
* data line -> how much data once transform
* control line -> the ability of CUP control other part
